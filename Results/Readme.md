In the First pic , i used handler to introduce a delay, whereas in the Second pic, i used a Timeunit.sleep (a thread likely to handle a delay)
As obvious, the 1st pic has a better performance compared to the second !
The third one(that termux sleep thing) obviously has a better performance compared to those, all pics are self explanatory 
**Also, in 2bit modulation, as i increase the number of samples(in steps of 100(totally 500 Strings(utf-8 encoding)), the difference number of b&c and a&d diverges. Also a corresponds to 00, b to 01, c to 10 and d to 11 , in 4-bit modulation for total 500 data, the result has been attached, and g dominates the frequency distribution , so we can conclude in both types of modulation, there is an intrinsic bias and the randomness of the data provides more power to the statement , in 4-bit modulation 0000 to 1111 is indicated by aplhabets in respective order , similar situation si observed for 2 aur 3 bit modulation.**.
