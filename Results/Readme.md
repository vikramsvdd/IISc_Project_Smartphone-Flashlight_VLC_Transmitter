In the First pic , i used handler to introduce a delay, whereas in the Second pic, i used a Timeunit.sleep (a thread likely to handle a delay)
As obvious, the 1st pic has a better performance compared to the second !
The third one(that termux sleep thing) obviously has a better performance compared to those 2
