In the First pic , i used handler to introduce a delay, whereas in the Second pic, i used a Timeunit.sleep (a thread likely to handle a delay)
As obvious, the 1st pic has a better performance compared to the second !
The third one(that termux sleep thing) obviously has a better performance compared to those 
Also, in 2bit modulation, as i increase the number of samples(in steps of 100(totally 500 data), the difference number of b&c and a&d diverges. Also a corresponds to 00, b to 01, c to 10 and d to 11
