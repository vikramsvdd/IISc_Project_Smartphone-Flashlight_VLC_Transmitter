# IISc- Workflow

1. Feb 11 : An Email from prof Chockalingam citing the need for using smartphone's flashlight as a transmitter of Information. He shared a paer to start with (https://github.com/vikramsvdd/Smartphone-Flashlight-Modulation-IISc-Project-/blob/main/VLC_References/vlc_smartpone.pdf) A study  done by a chinese university . From then, i started to research and work on the same. 
2. Came by Android studio as the best IDE for android app development as ease of loading the app into the smartphone. Started Developing the program and used the Camera Interface of the smartphone to access and control my flashlight.
3. Started developing the code , and used sleep function of thread as the function that implements the pulse width of my flashlight signal (either-on or off). 
4. Built a simple reciever circuit consisting of a photodiode and lm358 op-amp , and Arduino Uno acting as the intelligence.
5. Flashed a simple clock signal consisting of 0s and 1s alternating for 100 times (hereby called the clock signal from now on) onto the reciver circuit, probed an oscilloscope to view the output. 
6. A major problem became existent, the pulse width is deviating from the programmed pulse width rapidly . I programmed a 1 ms pulse width and the output pulse width varied from **5 ms to 15 ms**. Thus a deviation of 500 to 1700% from my programmed width is noted. A statistical test has been conducted to find the mean and variance of the pulse widths, the result is indicated in detail by (https://github.com/vikramsvdd/Smartphone-Flashlight-Modulation-IISc-Project-/blob/main/Results/plain_clock_signal_2.PNG)

7. As an alternative way of programming the pulse width, i used java's Executor Object to achieve my objective. It has a comparatively better performance in terms of less divergence of pulse width, the result is indicated in detail by https://github.com/vikramsvdd/Smartphone-Flashlight-Modulation-IISc-Project-/blob/main/Results/plain_clocksignal(with%201%20ms%20delay).PNG. But it is still not a solution , just an alternate way in which we faced the same problem . 

8. The chinese paper also detailed the same problem, but their solution was not clearly stated in the paper, and we were left in a state of perusal on how to resolove the problem by ourselves.
9. Landed on a new study (https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01683629/document) . They also detailed the same problem, and also had added that the pulse width variation varied for different smarphones as the problem is hugely OS dependent (OS introduces the delay as it is a GPOS and multithreaded). But they had proposed a solution to this problem. Encoding 1 and 0 in terms of pulse width was their attempt. I wrote a report that details how i collected the gist from several sources the HAL paper was one of them and had arrived at a solution (https://github.com/vikramsvdd/Smartphone-Flashlight-Modulation-IISc-Project-/blob/main/Results/clock-inconsistency.docx)
 10. So i was able to arrive at a solution and was able to flash my information ( eg:chockaingam in string (utf-8 encoding)). But there was a huge take , the data rate was too low, it was around **10 bits/second( hereforth called bps)** , which is too low by any standard and a motivation to increase the data rate was existent.
 11. In parallel, i also developed a fingerprint authentication feat to my modulation app to add additional security. The feat was achieved with the help of FingerprintManager module in android studio. 
 12. Subsequently i rethinked  that any 2 consecutive bits should have should have their equivalent symbol high time to be seperated by 17ms and made 0's symbol without any delay , whereas 1 symbol's high time is programmed to be 17ms long . Even though the clock pulses varied even in this case , i was able to transmit and recieve the data properly and was able to increase my datarate to **40 bps
// needs research //13. As a next step , i came to know of **Source-Coding** as a way of compressing the data and maximizing the data rate. In particular, i implemented **Multi-Bit-Modulation** as a solution. (One difference from normal source coding and my-kinda source coding is that, normally 0s and 1s are the final layer of abstraction in all coding stratergies, but in my kind, special symbols are the final one , because my source is itself inconsistant!). Firstly, i implemented 2-bit-modulation where 00,01,10 and 11 are allocated respective symbols which are seperated consecutively by 17ms (the threshold gap for Redmi-Note-5-Pro). The symbols are allocated based on the probability of occurence of  bi-bits(a way that i use to call 2 bits). For a particular string ifound out that d 10 are the first two most probable bi-bits, whereas 00 and 11 are the least probable bi-bits . **Thus the symbol with less duration gets allocated to the most probable bi-bits**. Thus i was able to increase my data rate ranging from **64 to 80 bps**. But in these, i specifically modified the reciever code for each string. But this is not a realistic solution simply because there are literally infinite names and modifying reciever code for each one is not a viable solution. Thus i ran a research for 500 random strings and found out a clear biasness in data for 3 types of modulation that i had carried out 
2 bit modulation(https://github.com/vikramsvdd/Smartphone-Flashlight-Modulation-IISc-Project-/blob/main/Results/2bitmodulationfreqdistri.PNG),2-cum-3_bit modulation(https://github.com/vikramsvdd/Smartphone-Flashlight-Modulation-IISc-Project-/blob/main/Results/2aur3bitmodulationfreqdistri.PNG) and 4 bit modulation (https://github.com/vikramsvdd/Smartphone-Flashlight-Modulation-IISc-Project-/blob/main/Results/4bitmodulationfreqdistri.png). I alloted symbols to each multi-bits and from (2 ms,18ms and on....upto number of levels).So one thing we can notice in the multi-bit-modulations are a **tradeoff** between number of pulsewidth levels with quantity of data, for eg, for 4 bit modulation there are 16 levels and the pulse width varies from (2 ms(1ms for on, one for off) to 256 ms!) but the number of data compresses to 96/4, for a 96 bit string. As per the freq distribution results i carried out the symbol allotment for different multi-bits and calculated the theoretical data rate for 2 bit,2-cum-3 bit and 4 -bit as 48.8 , 20 and 14.6 bps respectively . I also applied the same procedure to a string "chockalingam" and saw how it compares to the lot, and it has 38.8 for 2-bit, 20 for 2cum3 and 12.2 for 4 bit modulation. Thus some strings might be exceptional and differ slightly from the "lot". Ofcourse, practically the data rate might be even lower due to OS, but this theoretical comparision ensures that even though the number of bits reduces for multi-bit modulation , the number of levels increase and the pulse width increases in steps of 17ms, essentially bringing down the bit rate , thus w bit theoretically has a good performance compared to 2 cum 3 and 4 , and 1 has a even good performance (100 bps for the "lot") theoretically. (further research to be done on allocating symbols to each and every string individually as well as various other source coding methods).
